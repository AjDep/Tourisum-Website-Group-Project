    It has an interesting history closely related to that of the Sigiriya Rock Fortress. Being less grand and far more difficult to climb it is often overlooked by tourists.
    Like Sigiriya, Pidurangala was formed by volcanic activity. 
    Whilst Pidurangala appears larger than Sigiriya; its upper surface is steeply sloped and is of solid rock. 
    For this reason it was not suitable for large-scale building activity. 
    The rocky outcrops that surround the central rock gives one an indication of what the area around Sigiriya may have looked like prior to its clearing and preparation as a royal citadel.">
