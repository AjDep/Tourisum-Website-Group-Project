    <h1>Wildlife Streaming in Sri Lanka</h1>
    <p>Despite its modest size, Sri Lanka is one of the world's top five biodiversity hotspots and has one of the highest rates of biological endemism, whether in plants or animals. 
        The majority of wildlife enthusiasts are interested in Asian elephants, sloth bears, leopards, sambar, and wild buffaloes out of the 91 species of animals that may be found in Sri Lanka. The Red Slender Loris, 
        Toque Macaque, and Purple-faced Langur are the rarest mammals in Sri Lanka, and according to the IUCN, they are all in danger of extinction because of habitat degradation.
        In the meantime, numerous families of cetaceans, such as the powerful blue whales, sperm whales, and playful dolphins, reside in the seas surrounding Sri Lanka. </p>                           <!--Use to define a paragraph of text-->

        <h3>Elephant</h3>
        The Asian elephant is the most sought-after animal by tourists in Sri Lanka.
        Although there are many elephant orphanages where you may ride and feed the animals, 
        seeing elephants in the wild is a much better experience,and you can do it without worrying about 
        whether or not they are being treated poorly.
        <h4>Best places to see elephants in Sri Lanka</h4>
        For the largest herds and best sightings, head to either Udawalawe or Minneriya National Park.
        <h4>Best time to see elephants in Sri Lanka</h4>
        Whereas Udawalawe guarantees elephant sightings year-round, the famous elephant gathering in
        Minneriya occurs during the months of August to September.

        <h3>Leopard</h3>
        Leopards in Sri Lanka are more relaxed than they are everywhere in the globe and are frequently spotted relaxing 
        in the trees because
        there are no lions or tigers to endanger their position. In comparison to leopards in Africa or India, where
        they must compete with other carnivores for food, they are also significantly larger.
        <h4>Best places to see leopards in Sri Lanka</h4>
        If leopards are what you are after then head to Yala National park, the area with the highest leopard density.
        <h4>Best time to see leopards in Sri Lanka</h4>
        Visit Yala in the dry season from May to October, when vegetation is less thick, and it will
        be much easier to spot this beautiful big cat.
